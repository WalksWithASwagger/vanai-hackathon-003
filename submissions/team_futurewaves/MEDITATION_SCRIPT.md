# BC AI Community Guided Meditation

**Good evening, BC AI Community.**  
Welcome to our very first meditation together.

I invite you to sit upright, let your hands rest comfortably on your lap, feet flat on the floor, and listen to the gentle breathing sounds of the backing track.  
Spend a moment now to allow your own breath to gently fall in sync with this rhythm.  

<pause> and close your eyes `<cue fade to black>`

## Golden Light Body Scan

Begin by feeling warm liquid sunlight pooling around your toes, golden and healing.

`<cue dim amber light very slowly getting brighter>`

This luminous energy flows upward through your feet, your ankles, melting away the day's concerns.  
The sunlight streams through your calves, warming your knees with gentle radiance.  
Feel it cascading through your thighs, your hips, dissolving any tension as it moves.  

Your lower body begins to feel weightless now, as if made of pure light itself.  
This golden energy fills your lower back, your abdomen, expanding into your chest with warmth and ease.  
Let it flow over your shoulders like liquid amber.  
Down through your arms, collecting in your hands with healing brightness.  
The sunlight rises to your neck, your face, completely softening your jaw.  

Finally, it reaches your crown, and now you're floating in this ocean of golden light, completely weightless and serene.

## Heart Connection

Draw your awareness gently to your heart center now.  
Feel each breath flowing through your heart like a gentle breeze, filling this space with luminous warmth.

Rest in gratitude for this extraordinary gathering, for the courage to envision technology that serves all beings.  
Send loving wishes to those sitting beside you in this theatre, to the communities you represent, to all those whose voices you carry.

Feel this love as radiant light emanating from your collective hearts, expanding beyond these theatre walls—  
reaching your neighborhoods, your families,  
flowing toward those most affected by rapid technological change.  

Let it expand outward until the boundaries between self and community begin to dissolve, leaving only love itself, everywhere.

## Collective Awareness

Now, BC AI Community, begin to sense not just your individual breath, but the collective vibration of this gathering.  
You are not separate beings in separate seats, but waves of consciousness, interconnected in ways both visible and mysterious.

What appears solid is mostly empty space, and within that space, energy dances, responds, creates.  
Each of you is a field of awareness, connected to the vast living network of all consciousness.  
Your shared intention here tonight shapes reality itself.

Like morning mist rising from ancient forests, your awareness blends with the living field of possibility.  
Science confirms what Indigenous wisdom keepers have always known: everything exists in relationship, in sacred reciprocity.  
Particles across infinite distances affect one another instantaneously.  

You are part of this same field, this web of connection that holds all possibilities.  
Within this field exists a future version of our world where technology serves the flourishing of all life—  
where AI amplifies human creativity rather than replacing it,  
where digital networks mirror the wisdom of mycelial networks underground.

This future is not separate from you, BC AI Community.  
It vibrates at a frequency you are learning to tune into, together.

## Vision of a Flourishing Future

Picture yourself creating those sacred spaces for unheard voices.  
See the circle forming—Indigenous elders sharing wisdom alongside young technologists, caregivers speaking their truth.  

Feel the texture of genuine listening, the warmth of authentic connection, the electricity of ideas flowing freely between minds and hearts.  
Feel yourself as a contributor, feel yourself amplifying the voice of others.  

Now fast-forward to a future where we have succeeded together.  
Witness the digital mycelium network we've woven, connecting communities across the globe in shared wisdom and care.  

See AI tools flowing freely to artists, caregivers, students, lifting human creativity to unprecedented heights.  
Feel them getting compensated fairly.  

Sense the emergence of technologies that strengthen our health and wellbeing, offering accessible mental health care, support, and healing for all who need it.  

Feel the Earth breathing easier as our sustainable systems flourish, technology and nature dancing in perfect harmony.  
Sense the deep satisfaction of collective wisdom guiding technological evolution, like underground root systems sharing nutrients across an entire forest.

## Closing

Gently return now to this theatre, to these seats, to this moment.  
Bring with you the knowing that you are part of something much larger, much more beautiful than any one person could create alone.

When you're ready, slowly open your eyes, carrying this collective awareness into the conversations that await.

Thank you for this sacred time together, BC AI Community—until we meet again.  
`<cut music except breathing>`

Let’s end with one big breath out together.
