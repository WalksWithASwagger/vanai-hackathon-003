# Future Waves Submission

## Project Overview
For this hackathon, I wanted to explore how we can take the raw voices of 1,000 British Columbians and turn them into a shared experience that moves people toward hope, and from hope into creative action.  

The dataset contained a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended responses about AI: what people fear, what they hope for, and what they want to see in our collective future. Voices ranged from students to elders, technologists to land defenders, each speaking from their own lived reality.  

I began by analyzing the data through the open-ended answers and noting recurring themes with the use of ChatGPT.  

- **Fears**: job loss, loss of human connection, misinformation, the pace of change, and the risk of concentrated power.  
- **Hopes**: AI supporting mental health, amplifying creativity, enabling environmental stewardship, and building systems that include everyone.  

From these recurring hopes, I distilled a set of **pillars** that captured the community’s positive vision for AI in BC. Each pillar was then translated into a specific goal for how participants wanted to see AI supporting our province’s future.  

The live-guided meditation was built around helping participants visualize those goals as already becoming reality. It invited everyone to imagine a BC where AI strengthens community, honors Indigenous knowledge, supports health and mental well-being, and balances innovation with human dignity.  

The meditation closed with a set of **affirmations** distilled directly from community values, serving as a compass for building a BC AI ecosystem rooted in care, creativity, and inclusion.  

This approach demonstrates how qualitative data can be transformed into a participatory experience that leaves audiences with both an emotional shift and a shared vision — offering a prototype for cultural alignment as much as technical innovation.

## Technical Notes
The data was analyzed through conversational AI with **ChatGPT-4o**.  

- I uploaded the `.csv` dataset and requested a full analysis.  
- To prevent hallucinations, I asked for 5 actual quotes from the data for each theme.  
- Once I had a set of goals for BC, I fed them into a **goal-visualizing meditation and affirmation prompt**, which produced the meditation script using **Claude 4.0**.  
- I also created a short profile for "BC AI" which allowed the model to personalize the meditation and affirmations by name.  

The meditation was designed to:  
1. Bring the group into a calm, receptive, loving, connected state.  
2. Guide them through vivid mental imagery of these goals being realized and steps to get there.  
3. End with affirmations grounded in the community’s own words.
